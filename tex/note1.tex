\section{Quantum Annealing}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The energy landscape of a random Ising model like an Ising spin glass has a complex multimordal structure. It is difficult to find out its ground state.
  \item Because of the exponential increase in the number of states (exceeds $10^2$) we can't examine the energy of all the state.
  \item We can use the thermal fluctuation in simulated annealing. It helps the state of a system hop from one energy miminum to another. The ground state can be obtained by decreasing the temperature slowly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Combinatorial Optimization Problems}

\begin{eqnarray}
  H_{TSP} = \sum_{{\rm all \ links}} d_{\left <i, j \right >} \frac{S_{\left < i, j \right >} + 1}{2} \ .
\end{eqnarray}
under the conditions

\begin{eqnarray}
 \sum_{j} d_{\left <j, i \right >} \frac{S_{\left < i, j \right >} + 1}{2} = 1 \,
\end{eqnarray}
and
\begin{eqnarray}
 \sum_{j} d_{\left <i, j \right >} \frac{S_{\left < i, j \right >} + 1}{2} = 1 \ .
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Non-crossing Rule}

Let $H$ be an Hermite matrix of dimenstion $d$. If H has $f$ different engenvalues and each of them has $m_i \ (i = 1, 2, ..., f)$  multiplicity.

A unitary matrix is generally composed of $2d^2$ real parameters. However, due to the unitarity,
